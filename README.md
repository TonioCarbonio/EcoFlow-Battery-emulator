This project is to built a battery pack allowing the EcoFlow Powestream simulating an original battery, allowing my battery to be discharged and Charged up to 600W.

I'm referring to https://github.com/bulldog5046/EcoFlow-CanBus-Reverse-Engineering/tree/main this project. ATM no success in emulating the battery.
