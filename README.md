This project is to built a battery pack allowing the EcoFlow Powestream simulating an original battery, allowing my battery to be discharged and Charged up to 600W.

***** ******STEP 1****** *****

Understand how to emulate the original battery canbus. I have not an original battery just to clone it so:

* I'm referring to https://github.com/bulldog5046/EcoFlow-CanBus-Reverse-Engineering/tree/main this project.
* I'm referring also to https://github.com/GridSpace/wattzup.
* CAN LOG and works are made with https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib.


ATM I'm here, no succes.
  
***** ******STEP 2****** *****

After a "poor" emulation, test if it possibile to set some specific value (e.g. SoC).

***** ******STEP 3****** *****

Built up a battery
